    "Directions": "This is a strengthening exercise for forearm and wrist. Support your forearm using a bench, table or your thigh and hold a weight with your palms facing the floor. Extend the wrist maximally and slowly lower the weight at a 5-second tempo. You may use your other hand to help pull the weight into end range extension in order to make the concentric phase easier.",
