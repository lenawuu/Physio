    "Title": "BAND PULL DEAD BUG",
    "Directions": "The band pull dead bug is a core endurance exercise that aims to also teach you how to uncouple hip movements from the pelvis and spine. This exercise is best done on a yoga mat or other soft floor surface. Start on your back and grip onto a band that is anchored above your head and behind you. Pull the band until yours arms are in line with your shoulders. Tilt your pelvis backwards by tucking your tail bone to get get into a neutral spine position. Hold the position by bracing your core and then raise your legs to be directly above your hips. Alternate extending your leg one at a time without resting the leg on the floor. While doing this exercise it is important that you hold the spine in neutral to challenge the core muscles effectively.",
