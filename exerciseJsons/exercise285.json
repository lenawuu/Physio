    "Title": "KETTLEBELL SWING",
    "Directions": "This is a strength and conditioning exercise for the posterior chain, namely the back extensors, core, and hip extensors. Start by holding a kettlebell between your legs with both hands. Keep your feet at least shoulder distance apart. Bend your knees and hinge at your hips to keep the spine neutral during this exercise. From here, extend the hips and knees and use the momentum generated to swing the kettlebell forward. Be sure to keep the arms and shoulders lax so that you are not raising the weight with your upper body, but rather using your arms to simple transfer the force from your legs to the kettlebell. From the top position allow the weight to swing back down and in between your legs to complete a repetition.",
