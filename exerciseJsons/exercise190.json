    "Title": "KNEE SLINGSHOTS",
    "Directions": "This is a knee proprioception exercise that uses a band and light weight plate as a self stimulated source of perturbation. Start by anchoring down a band to a stable object beside you at knee height. Feed the band through the hole of a 2.5 lbs or light weight plate and loop the band around the target knee. Take a single leg stance and bend the knee to engage a muscular lock. Pull the weight plate directly upwards and let go to allow it to drop directly downwards to shake the band. Resist the band\u2019s motion and remain balanced on one leg. Be sure to do a straight vertical pull on the weight plate to prevent it from hitting your body.",
