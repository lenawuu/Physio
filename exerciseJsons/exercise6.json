    "Title": "BEAR HUG FLEXION - EXTENSION",
    "Directions": "This is a thoracic mobility exercise that aims to increase flexion and extension range of motion. The bear hug position is used to dissociate scapular motion away from the thoracic spine. This is important for those who tend to end up with shoulder pain as they use their shoulder to compensate for lack of thoracic spine mobility",
