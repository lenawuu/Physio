    "Title": "SHORT FOOT SIDE LEAN",
    "Directions": "This is a muscle activation exercise to teach you how to engage and control the intrinsic foot muscles responsible for stabilizing the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). While contracting the intrinsic muscles of the foot it is important to dissociate movement away from the toes. While keeping the toes relaxed, pull up the MLA by pulling the ball of your big toe towards your heel. Hold this muscular contraction and lean on one leg to provide additional resistance.",
