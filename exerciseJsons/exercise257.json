    "Title": "CLUBBELL ISOMETRIC ROTATION",
    "Directions": "This is a lumbar stability exercise that utilizes a clubbell. Start with your feet roughly hip distance apart and hands gripping the handle of the clubbell horizontally. Hinge at the hips and bend the knees until your hands hands just in front of your knees. Stand over the weight so that it is directly below and in line with your armpit. Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Rotate the torso to engage the obliques and hold an isometric contraction for 5-7 seconds. Slowly return to neutral rotation and repeat as required.",
