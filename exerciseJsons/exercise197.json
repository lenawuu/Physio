    "Title": "KNEES OVER TOES FRONT LUNGE",
    "Directions": "This is an advanced version of the SPLIT SQUAT exercise that utilizes deep knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion to increase knee extensor loading. Start by lunging forwards while allowing your knee to past your toes as far as you comfortably can. Do not allow the front heel to lift off of the floor during this phase. Once maximum knee flexion is reached, drive through the heel to push the body backwards to standing position. You may alternate sides or repeat on the same side depending on your goals.",
