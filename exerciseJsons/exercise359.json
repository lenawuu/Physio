    "Title": "PRONE EXTENSION WITH DOWEL",
    "Directions": "This is a back extension strengthening exercise that uses a broomstick or dowel. Start by lying stomach down on a padded surface with your hands raised in front your head while holding a dowel. Begin to segmentally extend your spine by visualizing each vertebrae moving one at a time. As you extend your spine lift your hands off of the floor. Make sure you keep your lower limbs on the ground to minimize hip extension involvement.",
