    "Directions": "The assisted prone neck bridge exercise is used to strengthen the muscles of the neck, upper back and shoulders. Start by placing a yoga mat or exercise mat on the floor to have padding for your head. Place the top of your head on the floor and support your upper body with your arms and lower body with your legs. Hinge at the hips to keep a neutral spine. Support your lower body with the balls of your toes. Hold this position for up to 8 seconds or as tolerated. Slowly lower the body back down to the ground to complete a repetition.",
