    "Title": "STABILITY BALL PEC FLY / CHEST FLY",
    "Directions": "This is a chest strengthening exercise that uses a Swiss ball to increase anti-rotational core demand. Lie down on the ball so that it supports your upper back and neck. Hold two dumbbells at the level of your lower chest and press them upwards until your hands are straight above your shoulders. You may bend the elbows slightly for comfort. Slowly lower your hands towards the floor by spreading them outwards while keeping them in line with your chest horizontally. Raise your hands back up by pulling them together until you return back to starting position.",
