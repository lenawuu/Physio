    "Title": "SHOULDER PRESS AND SHRUG",
    "Directions": "This is a modified shoulder press exercise that adds in an end range shrug to recruit the Upper Trapezius muscle. We want to recruit this muscle when it is tight because strengthening a muscle increases a muscle\u2019s tolerance to stretch - helping with decreasing muscle tension. In this instance, we do not want to \u2018keep the shoulders down and back\u2019. This exercise is ideally performed with light weights only (<50% 1 RM or RPE).",
