    "Title": "INTERNAL ROTATION HIP LIFT",
    "Directions": "This is an internal hip rotation mobility and stability exercise. Start by lying down on your back with a yoga block or foam roller between your knees and heels planted on a bench. Squeeze the yoga block and raise the pelvis one inch off the ground. Hold the raised position for up to 5 seconds. Come back down to a rested position to complete the first repetition. Then rotate one leg out by 5-10 degrees and complete another hip lift. Repeat until 45 degrees of hip rotation is achieved or until the maximum range you can tolerate is achieved for the day.",
