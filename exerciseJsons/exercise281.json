    "Title": "STANDING BANDED ROW",
    "Directions": "This is a strengthening exercise to target the scapular retractors. Loop a band around a stable object such as a door anchor or squat rack in front of you. Grab both ends of the band with your hands and complete a row. Focus on retracting the shoulders blades back as if to hold a pencil your scapula. Keep the shoulders down and back as you complete this exercise to isolate the movement away from the shoulder muscles. Lead the motion with your elbows to pull the band towards your abdominal region.",
