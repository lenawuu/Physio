    "Title": "TOE CURL CIRCLES",
    "Directions": "This foot exercise challenges and strengthens the intrinsic muscles of the foot in multiple ankle ranges. This looks much easier than it is! Curl your toes as much as you comfortably can while making ankle circles - if you start to feel your foot cramp up then decrease the amount of toe flexion you are doing. This cramp sensation will decrease over time as your foot adapts and gets STRONGER",
