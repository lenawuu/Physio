    "Title": "CONVENTIONAL DEADLIFT",
    "Directions": "This is a strength training posterior chain compound movement that uses weight plates and a barbell. Start with your feet roughly hip distance apart and hands gripping the bar shoulder distance apart. Hinge at the hips and bend the knees to maintain a neutral spine. Stand over the bar so that it is directly below and in line with your armpit. Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Lift the bar up by driving the feet into the ground and extending the hips and knees. Keep the bar as close to the body as possible during the entire lift. It is important to stand tall at the top of the movement instead of hyperextending the low back. Lower the weight by reversing the motion.",
