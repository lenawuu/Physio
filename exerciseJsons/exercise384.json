    "Title": "TVA CRUNCH",
    "Directions": "The transverse abdominis crunch is an exercise that combines core bracing with rectus abdominis activation to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor and abdominal wall. Start by lying in a crook lying position (knees bent with feet flat on the floor). Use both hands to feel the lower abdominal wall muscles location at the front of your pelvis. Engage these muscles by gentle lifting your fingers with your lower abdominal wall. Complete a crunch by lifting the upper back (including the shoulder blades) off of the floor. Exhale as you lift your upper back off of the floor. Return to a rested position while inhaling with the diaphragm.",
