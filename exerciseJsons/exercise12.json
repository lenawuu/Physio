    "Title": "BANDED SPIDERMAN STRETCH",
    "Directions": "This banded hip joint mobilization targets your hip capsule. The hip capsule surrounds the femoralacetabular joint and can become irritated in conditions like Hip Impingement. For this exercise use a heavy strength band (100 lbs resistance shown in the video) and hold the position for 1-2 minutes. This exercise can also be done on the floor however elevating the foot on a bench does make this hip mobility exercise much easier.",
