Start by sitting down on the floor with your legs bent to 90 degrees a the knees and feet placed wider than shoulder width apart. Proceed to internally rotate the front leg and externally rotate the back leg until both knees reach the floor. From here lift the pelvis off the ground to engage the hip muscles.
