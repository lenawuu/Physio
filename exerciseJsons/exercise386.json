Start by lying down in a crook lying position. Place both of your hands along the front of your pelvis. Engage the TVA by contracting it to gently raise your fingers upwards. Maintain this contraction as you begin to lift up one leg off of the floor until your reach 90 degrees hip flexion. Lower the leg without losing the contraction and alternate sides.",
