    "Title": "THIGH BLOCK FULL EXTENSION",
    "Directions": "This is a full spine extension mobility exercise that requires an eccentric contraction of your abdominal wall. Start by blocking the front of your thighs while in a kneeling position using a stable object like a wall. Be sure to kneel on a padded surface to protect your knees. Raise your arms straight overhead and  extend your spine backwards, resisting slowly against the force of gravity. Take between 5 to 7 seconds to reach your tolerable end range and return back to starting position at a 2 second tempo (concentric phase). Repeat as required.",
