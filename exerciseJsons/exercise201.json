    "Title": "DRAW THE SWORD",
    "Directions": "This is a rotator cuff strengthening exercise that uses an exercise band to provide multidirectional resistance. Anchor one end of the band down by stepping on it or tying it down to a stable object. Start with the target shoulder\u2019s hand at the opposite hip with the thumb pointed backwards while gripping the band. Simultaneously rotate the hand into a thumbs up position as your pull the band across the body and overhead. This motion should resemble drawing a sword and saluting it overhead.",
