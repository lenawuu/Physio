    "Title": "TACTICAL FROG",
    "Directions": "This is a hip mobility exercise that challenges internal rotation. Start on your elbows and knees on soft flooring or mat. Keep your knees at least shoulder distance apart and keep your spine neutral. Rotate both thighs inwards as far as you can (feet will rotate away from the body) and hold for up to 5 seconds. Doing both legs at the same time prevents movement compensation through hip hiking or side crunching of the torso.",
