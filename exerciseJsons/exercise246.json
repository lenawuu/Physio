    "Title": "BILATERAL INTERNAL ROTATION HIP BRIDGE",
    "Directions": "This is an internal hip rotation mobility and stability exercise. Start by lying down on your back with a yoga block or foam roller between your knees and heels planted on a bench. Squeeze the yoga block and raise the pelvis off the ground by going into full hip extension. Come back down to a rested position to complete the first repetition. Then rotate both legs out by 5-10 degrees and complete another bridge. Repeat until 45 degrees of hip rotation is achieved or until the maximum range you can tolerate is achieved for the day.",
