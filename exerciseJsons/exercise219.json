    "Title": "INTERNAL ROTATION PLATE PERTURBATION",
    "Directions": "This is a stability and proprioception exercise for the shoulder and rotator cuff muscles. Start by anchoring on end of a band to a stable object and loop it through a fractional weight plate. Grip the other end and orient your body so that the hand gripping the band is the one closest to the anchor point. Bend your elbow to 90 degrees elbow flexion. Take a step away from the band\u2019s anchor point to increase the tension in the band (providing internal rotation resistance). Use your free hand to pull on the weight plate and let go to allow it to shake the band. Stabilize the shoulder by resisted the movement generated.",
