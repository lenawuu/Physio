    "Title": "DUMBBELL WINDMILL",
    "Directions": "The dumbbell windmill exercise is a compound movement used to improve shoulder, core, and back stability. Start by holding a dumbbell with one hand. Widen up your stance so that your feet are at least shoulder distance apart. Raise the dumbbell straight overhead and lock the arm in a vertical position. Keep about a 25 degree bend in the knees and hinge forwards at the hips. Continue hinging at the hips while rotating the torso so that the arm is vertical to the floor. Run your free hand down the inner aspect of your thigh and leg until you touch the floor. Return to a standing position by reversing the motion to complete a repetition.",
