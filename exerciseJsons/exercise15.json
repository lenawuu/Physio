    "Title": "REACTIVE LATERAL CATCH",
    "Directions": "This is a late stage rotator cuff rehabilitation exercise that strengthens the shoulder and improves joint proprioception. The rotator cuff has been shown to increase in muscle activity with grip based activities. This exercise takes advantage of this mechanism by stressing the shoulder joint while repeatedly grip and relaxing the hand through a ball drop and catch movement. The lateral catch position is used to target the supraspinatus muscle concentrically and the other rotator cuff muscles as co-stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint.",
