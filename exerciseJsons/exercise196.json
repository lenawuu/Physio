    "Title": "HALF SQUAT PALLOF SIDE STEP",
    "Directions": "This is a core stability exercise that will challenge your anti-rotation core endurance. This exercise may help with low back, hip, knee or ankle related issues experienced while doing a loaded squat. Be sure to keep the shoulders stacked above the hips during this exercise, and your full spine in neutral. Anchor a strength band down to a stable object next to you and hold the other hand with both hands at the level of your navel. Squat down into a half squat position and extend your elbows to press the band forwards. Take a small step to the side and hold for 2 seconds before taking another step. Step out as far as you can comfortable resist and step back in to starting position.",
